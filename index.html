<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
	<p>My name is Rajiv Hemanth. I'm currently pursuing a Masters in Analytics from the National University in Singapore.
	   Mine has been a pretty long and winding path to the field of Data Science - I completed my Bachelors in Computer
	   Science Engineering from the University of Madras way back in 2004. Then did a couple of stints with IT majors. 
	   Kind of followed the herd and did an MBA from IIT Madras. Worked with a Big 4 firm on IT consulting.
		
	   
	   
	   But then like car enthusiasts who get the itch to change their cars periodically, I too got that itch to switch 
	   fields again. And started exploring Analytics, Data Science etc. And now I find myself sitting in class with mates  
	   who were in primary school when I got my first job. It is fun :-). So for people who are on the fence - in a
           dilemma whether they can make the switch from their current work roles to data science, may be I can serve as
	   an inspiration.
	   
	   I hope to invest a lot of time in projects apart from coursework. Currently, working on a chatbot. Next in pipeline                  
           is to make a simple tic tac toe game and make it learn on its own - inspired by Tom Mitchell's Machine Learning   
           Chapter 1. </p>
