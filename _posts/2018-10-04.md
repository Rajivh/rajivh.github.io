Ever wondered what is the difference between Standard error and deviation. Well it turns out that the Standard Error of the mean is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample means. Well that was a mouthful. 

Let's break it up into smaller chunks. Like how we attack the inner most chunk of a nested loop, here let us start by understanding sampling distribution of sample means.
