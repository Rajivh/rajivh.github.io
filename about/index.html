	<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
	<p>My name is Rajiv Hemanth. I'm currently pursuing a Masters in Analytics from the National University in Singapore.
	   Mine has been a pretty long and winding path to the field of Data Science - I have been a rainwater harvester, 	     water conservation consultant and have done stints in IT audit and Software Testing. 
	   Over the course of 5 years, I designed and implemented systems with a combined total of over 35 million litres of 		roof top rainwater harvesting potential and aquifer recharge of 0.3 million litres (predominantly in Bangalore, 	   India). 
	   I took to vegetable gardening inspired by the many stories of roof top vegetable gardens sprouting all over 	 	    Bangalore. My initial conventional approach did not show great results - stunted growth/ pest attacks etc. 	
	   Subsequently, with the help of a permaculture expert, experimented with a raised vegetable bed. The difference was 
           just day and night between the two approaches. The plants were much more resistant to pests and the yield was 
           higher as well. Would want to own a patch of land and experiment with growing fruits and vegetables. Ah! One 
	   day</p>
