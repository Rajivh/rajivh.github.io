	<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
	<p>My name is Rajiv Hemanth. I'm currently pursuing a Masters in Analytics from the National University in Singapore.
	   Prior to this, I have been a rainwater harvester, water conservation consultant and have done stints in IT audit 	       and Software Testing.

	   It's been an exciting journey so far, 
	   * what seemed to be plain jargons till a while back, am now gradually able to make sense of them,
	   * hard realization about the powers of Math as compared to my blissful ignorance during school when I used to 
	     wonder where am I going to apply all these Calculus and Matrices, 
	   * really humbled by the depth in knowledge of various people out there - Andrew Ng, Andrej Karpathy, Chris Olah, 
	     Geoffrey Hinton (who at 70 is sought after) etc., 
	   * and am inspired by a lot of fellow bloggers out there who have helped me immensely in digesting complex topics 
	     with their most insightful blogs on topics related to Machine Learning. 
	</p>
	<p>
	   I also hope to contribute and inspire - someone, somewhere.
